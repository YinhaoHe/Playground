# Python

- Python is by default CPython, there are also Jython...

- Same as Java, when executing Python, it first translate Python code into **Python ByteCode**, then **Python Virtual Machine** will translate ByteCode to machine code(0101001). So Python can run across different platform(OS).. 
- **Jython** is implemented with Java on low level. So you can **import Java code into Jython**, because those code will end up being translated to **Java ByteCode**, then **JVM** translates ByteCode to machine code..
